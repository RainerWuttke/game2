# Game Title

## Hi, this is my second game project inspired in a [hungry games](http://brantsteele.net/hungergames/disclaimer.php) game. 

I see this game's events are just random, e.g. an event that you have found a gun, but later you kill the enemy with a stick or you die from dehydration even on previous events you found water.

My idea was to try to put some intelligence on it. When you create the characters it has stats and personality too.
When the game starts it uses items, inventory, personality, relationship and terrain, to know what each character can and will do.

## This game is not currently in develop, but I have plans to continue the idea.
